<p> This person is one of my best friends, his name is Jordy. We have been friends for that past 5 years and we have made tons of memories. This picture was taken during school when we had to do the drill that took an hour. We had a great time during the drill, because once we got there, we started to play catch with paper balls, and then we started to go around looking for our friends in the other classes. Jordy ended up taking my phone when we were playing catch and he started to take a bunch of photos, and this was one of them. I didn't delete any of them, because I felt like those would be great to have as memories.

<p> To be honest I forgot that this was a hero page, and I just remembered, but Jordy is actually one of my heroes, because he brought me into the real world. Jordy literally made me talk to people in middle school, and now I'm am such a different person today then I was before in middle school because of Jordy. Jordy has definitely made a huge impact on my life and my social life, and I don't know what I would've done without him. I can't even imagine what I would be like if I have never met him.
